                    With the right strategies and tactics, every artist can get their music in front of the right
                    people. Here are some tips:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        Create a Press Release to send to Blogs, Online Newspapers, Magazines, and Radio Stations etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Build your network: Network as much as you can within your local scene (think: club nights,
                        festivals or industry parties), send your music to promoters, and engage with your own community
                        online.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Share your music in niche communities: Identify your target audience and the places they are
                        consuming new music. When you’re armed with the insights, start actively participating in
                        conversations or discussions and sharing your tracks in their niche communities, whether it be a
                        Facebook group or Twitch channel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reach out to blogs and Youtube channels: There are a number of handy tools out there to help get
                        your music featured on the best blogs and channels, without having to do the guesswork. Try Hype
                        Machine, a platform that automatically aggregates the best blogs around the world for you to
                        contact based on popularity. Also, SubmitHub is another great and user-friendly platform where
                        you can submit directly to blogs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To increase your reach and have a chance to go on Spotify, Apple Music, and Deezer Playlists you
                        can sign up to free services such as DailyPlaylists, SoundPlate, IndieMono, and SubmitHub. Go
                        ahead and use these services for your chance to get onto popular user playlists. Do not by any
                        circumstance pay Spotify Playlist owners/curators for placement. They usually use bots and fake
                        streaming tactics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can also contact playlist curators directly via Instagram and Facebook. The best way to find
                        their contact details is to go on Spotify and find the playlist you’d like to be on. Then find
                        the user of that playlist. They usually have their contact details there. Send them a quick
                        message on Facebook / Instagram explaining your release and how much you love their playlist.
                        They love that!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another cool thing with the above-mentioned service SubmitHub is that you can send your music to
                        popular influencers on TikTok and Instagram. If they like your song, they can promote it for you
                        by using it in their video! It’s a win for them because they love new music, but also a great
                        win for you because you will gain more exposure.
